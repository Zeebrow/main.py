It's a piece of crap.

`quickhost` feels absolutely huge and unmanageable. It still needs so many
tweaks, and as I go through the code to fix them, I keep finding so much stuff
wrong with it. Permissions being the biggest of problems (too lax). I need to
just get this thing working... If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

## exceptions

I am close to reading logs a bit better as an admin.

I have a nested set of try-catch statements, where I want to fail the app
immediately if we can't call 'DescribeVpcs' or `DescribeWubnets`. I logged them
as critical:

```
2022-07-08 14:14:41,956 : quickhost_aws.AWSNetworking : describe : CRITICAL: The user qweafae couldn't perform the operation 'DescribeVpcs'.
2022-07-08 14:14:41,956 : quickhost_aws.AWSNetworking : describe : ERROR: The user qweafae couldn't perform the operation 'DescribeVpcs'.
```

```python
try:
  try:
    describe_vpcs()
    describe_subnets()
  except Unauthorized:
    logger.critical("The user...")
except Unauthorized as e:
  logger.warning("The user...")
```

I've known of this concept of how stack traces work (operative word there being
'stack'), but this let me in a bit further. So that was neat.

I also learned that I need to raise a difference exception in order to let the
caller kill the app, and inseat return an appropriate exit code for the CLI.

# perf


Since it's Friday, I thought I'd veer off and do something different, and it
just so happens that I need unit tests lmao.

`quickhost.store_test_data` should be a wrapper function that intercepts
responses from `boto3.session.Session`, decides if it's a response we need, and
then saves it to file. Right now, it's kinda janky. But it sounds like a nice
rabbithole.

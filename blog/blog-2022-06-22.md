# today

I've been on my hiatus writing CI/"CD" for [drcat (formerly fmt-md-text)](https://github.com/zeebrow/fmt-md-text). 
[define](https://github.com/zeebrow/define) might be  abetter candidate for the
CD part, in 2 more years... I want `define` to be shareable, so ~~everyone~~
anyone can use the same API key. MW promised not to get greedy for our small
amount of users (friends).

I miss being able to set variables when a program is compiled.


## init

Need to set up these things (at least) for fam to `init` an aws plugin:

* [ ]credentials
* [ ]vpc
* [ ]subnet
* [ ]routing
* [ ]...

... also what do they do when they uninstall the plugin? Resources just kinda
sit there, burning $. Sounds straight forward.

# today

I ran `main.py aws make -n qwer`, and now I want to delete it... but that will
have to come later.

First, tests.

Maybe a reason tests are so overwhelming is because of how dense they are. Take
for example the current `test_aws_describe()` function:

```python
# Pretty standard stuff
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch
import pytest
from pathlib import Path
import re

# A highly suspect Python3 package
from quickhost import AWSApp

# jsons-turned-dicts
from fixtures.fixt_aws_cli import new_parser
from fixtures.sg_client_responses import patched_describe_sg, patched_describe_kp, patched_describe_host

# "We don't want any boto3.client() function calls to actually happen"
@patch('boto3.client')
def test_aws_describe(mock_boto_client, capsys):
    # Any time a client is made, return a mock
    mock_boto_client.return_value = mock_boto_client

    # What we actually want returned from specific boto3.client methods, in this case, dictionaries.
    # They give very similar output to what you might find when using the aws cli
    mock_boto_client.describe_security_groups.return_value = patched_describe_sg
    mock_boto_client.describe_key_pairs.return_value = patched_describe_kp
    mock_boto_client.describe_instances.return_value = patched_describe_host

    # Convenience vaiables
    user_overridden_cfg_file = 'tests/data/another_test_aws_config.conf'
    app_name = 'test_load_config_cli_arg'
    pretend_arparser_args = {'app_name':'test_load_aws_config_cli_overrides_file', 'config_file': user_overridden_cfg_file}

    # Pretend like we had gotten a vars(argparse.Namespace) from main.py
    c = AWSApp(**pretend_arparser_args)
    pretend_aws_args = { "__qhaction": 'describe', "app_name": "asdf", }

    # Compile some reggies to match against the 'cli' output
    sg_pat = re.compile(r'^sgid(?:\.)* (?P<sgid_val>.*)')
    kp_pat = re.compile(r'^kpid(?:\.)* (?P<kpid_val>.*)')
    host_pat = re.compile(r'^ec2ids(?:\.)* \[\'(?P<ec2ids_val>i-[0-9a-f]*)\'\]')
    # (hence the blogpost ðŸ¤£)
    dummpy_pat = re.compile(r'asdfie7ysgaigk9oy8hiuk')

    # We're planning on calling `exit()`, so pytest needs to know.
    with pytest.raises(SystemExit):
        # Assign our pretend args to the AWSApp instance
        c.load_cli_args(pretend_aws_args)

        # pytest - we want to measure what gets printed to stdout and stderr
        captured = capsys.readouterr()

        sg_match = sg_pat.match(captured.out)
        kp_match = kp_pat.match(captured.out)
        host_match = host_pat.match(captured.out)
        dummy_match = dummpy_pat.match(captured.out)

        # Match (none of these worked for me)
        # Values are selected to match those in the json-to-dict`s
        assert sg_match.groups()[0] == 'sg-04bf04a4a22a9f07e'
        assert kp_match.groups()[0] == 'key-0b4a1597913d76bd6'
        assert host_match.groups()[0] == 'i-0f34a77c50806fff2'
        # ...despite such efforts
        assert dummy_match is not None
        assert False

# Test produces false positive
```

With this bad test in mind, I am going to go over it again, separating each
`assert`ion into its own function. It will make for much more code than might
be required, but I need to be able to troubleshoot this more effectively than I
have been.

This app absolutely sucks, LOL.

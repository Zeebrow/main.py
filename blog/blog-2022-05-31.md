# today

aws plugin works, barely.

Can't say that it was an aweful experience because I have nothing to compare it to, lol. But jeez, the number of gotchas...

# tomorrow

* The code is still in the `quickhost` repo
* Tests have to be moved (and validated)
* plugin should import `quickhost` to get at the `AppBase` class

## authentication

I'm looking for a better way to go on CRUDing resources, than relying on an aws
cli configuration file in `~/.aws/credentials`. I don't think this is going to
happen. I would have to create something akin to registration for the app,
asking to allow *my* account's users to be able to assume roles in *your*
account's roles, and ... yeah, nah. Sketch.

The only way is to have the user setup their own AWS account, and have permissions to create users/roles/etc for QH to use durring init.

<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-api.html>

### option 1

1. QH user calls `init aws`
1. Create `quickhost` IAM user 
1. Create role per CRUD

1. QH user calls C/R/U/D
1. QH assumes role

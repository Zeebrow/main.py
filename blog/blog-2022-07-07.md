## run on all ther versions!!

'member when I got sick of that `importlib.metadata` deprication warning, and
fixed it by changing code?

Well, I 'member. And it turns out it broke the code for Python versions <=3.10.
xD. What are my options?

* ? Check `sys.version` and import accordingly
* ? from __future__
* ? requirements.txt?

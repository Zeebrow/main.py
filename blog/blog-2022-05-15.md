# today

we yay.

made a host, it was p quick

But, tests broke, and am becoming truly annoyed with `-y`...

What this thing *really* needs is a rewrite. Each aws resource ('thingy')
should extend a base class with CRUD methods. `AWSHost` actually needs a method
to handle the ec2 keypair, plus `describe()`.

# tomorrow

* `AWSHost._create_key_pair()`
* `AWSHost.describe()`
* ~~write tests~~

I `reset --hard` a bunch of crap that may or may not have been The Wayâ„¢.

It was basically object-orienting what I thought was important in quickhost.
Turned out to be the cli args, but in retrospect, it didn't make too much
sense. The idea was to basically 'marshal' all of the plugin CLI args into a
`dataclass` (like when I first started this project). The advantage is that it
would simplify the parsing/param-ing code in the plugin, as well as provide an
interface of sorts for `create()`/`describe()`/... No need to check the "shape"
of a function's return-dict, it's gonna fit in the args class!

The downside is (re)writing a bunch of boiler plate, and converting each and
every CRUD to use this class.

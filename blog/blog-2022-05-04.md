# Terrible commit

I'm at this point.

I've been here before.

Before, I had an app, but the config was all janky. Now I've got config... How do I make an app?

## caught a bug

App args were magically getting set to `None`... I needed to switch the default
argparse params for `argparse.SUPPRESS`

## no room for app params

So I want to set a default value for the ports that are opened to the app.
...Or do I? I've torn plenty of "apps" up this way, wanting to change how it's
configured once I've gotten this far. Sticking with stupid is basically letting
`argparse` decide how to handle defaults, but this conflicts with the [##](caught a bug)

# hashtag bloglife

## `blog` shell function

automatically opens todays blog

not in love with it because I had to add the `export`, but it fits well with
how I work.

## vim markdown 

Took me longer than I care to admit to make this line up:

`autocmd bufreadpre *.md,*.txt set tabwidth=79`

Wordwrapping is a necessity for doing this blog thing.

## back from the grave (again)

I took `src/scripts/main.py` largely as-is from the "old" project and pasted it
in place. I got rid of the subparsers, I can't recall them being anything more
than a nuisance:
* subparsers don't even get their own namespace (why I originally wanted them)
* separating options into groups like "security group parameters" is
  unneccessary, IMO. (the user shouldn't need to care about that level of
  detail)


I'm tempted to use the `click` package, but a framework will make any resulting
binary that much larger. I don't think quickhosts needs it. Maybe it's a good
idea to organize the code "just in case"?

```python
@click.command
def funkyfunc():
  pass
```

...nah. `Argparse` is fine, What Could Possibly Go Wrong??


## testing

I'm already overthinking this.

I want to write a test for `convert_datetimes_to_string()`, but it's for sure
not going to be part of the `quickhost` package. So, that means it shouldn't be
tested. right??

Maybe "testable features" is a good goal...

## end of day 1

Nothing works. Everything worked just fine, but no. Just *had* to do the app
thingy!!

I was looking at Ansible's [repo](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/devel/test/units) and found the 
6-year old commit message on `__init__.py`:

```
 Add empty-init code-smell script. (#18406) 
```

lol. I am encouraged to fumble my way through this.

It looks like I've committed a lot, but its mostly just the skeleton of the old
project (I keep calling it that...). Tomorrow, I will move things towards
working code, and once I'm there, think about testing it.

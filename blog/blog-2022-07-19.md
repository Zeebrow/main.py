I've come to realize the way `main.py` is programmed respects authority differently in more than a handful of places.  I have to apologize to myself, for putting me through this.

It's not important in any way: The app works. Don't take this the wrong way, holy moly it has been absolutely mind-blowing working with all of these nuts and bolts. But that's part of the problem. It sucks to work with what I've made, especially coming back from even a week off. The hyperactivities intertwined in this pile of plugin is better off in the AWS cli. 

I need to find a better way to say "I've pored over every inch of your documentation" to Python devs. Inspiring stuff~

`C:\Users\...` never made it, and this is probably why I'm staying without unit tests 

How wrong am I in avoiding getting a Windows-oriented app working (not some, AFAIK, useless PS thing). I just don't know it, it is a gigantic realm of unknowns I was looking down. I need to finish this from another computer to fix that.

# today

I had done a think, and I have come to a conclusion:

``` 
The config file needs to go.  
```

Or at least be available as an option only. Maybe one day, access to another's
apps will be shareable by importing it.

Removing the configuration file implies:

* `quickhost` should be able to determine what you need to create (the 'list'
  is in the [aws plugin's README.md]())
* `quickhost-aws` needs an `init` function to create `vpc`, `subnet`, `igw`, `routetable`, and others
  - These are global, "app agnostic" resources
  - may as well walk through `aws` cli setup (and create role for QH to assume)
* `quickhost-aws` needs an `destroy-all` function to remove the above.

*None of that is possible* because quickhost relies on the `[section:name]` to
infer which plugin to load!!

This problem isn't solvable with the current state of the app.

1. config file stays
2. charge $1.50/yr to host configuration
3. `--aws` or similar cli flags
...
4. scrap plugins

# The future of state: `quickstate`

j/k. But seriously!

Instead of looking up names in a file, and figuring out what plugin to use based on the alignment of your `:`, just throw some boilerplate down when you `pip install quackhost-plugin`. That boilerplate would be a new function that requires `app_name`, just like every other function a plugin provides. 

We're already looking for plugins regardless of whether they're installed or not. We're also assuming that there can be an infinite number of plugins, which is pretty dumb, especially considering the number of cloud provides will never not fit into a `uint8`. But I digress.

observation: Every cloud provider will require the user to init some "state" with them - for AWS, its a VPC (or more generally, an account - but that's not something that we can query). 

caveat: I have to figure out how to use `async/await`. 

I'm betting the farm that any and all cloud providers with a Python API support asyncronous usage. If not, we go rawdawg with threads on something urllib.

Proactively planning the next major release!â„¢

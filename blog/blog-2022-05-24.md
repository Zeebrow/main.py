# yesterday

Last night, I ate a pepperoni that had fallen on the floor. I mean, I'm 99% positive it was a pepperoni.

# today

That pepperoni may have been the muse I needed to reshape `quickhost` to
support plugins. I made the `main-args` branch to follow this refactor idea.

## plugins - rationale

TL:DR;

* executable size




## plugins research - on the shoulders of giants!

Here's some blogs I've glanced at:

### [Mathieu Larose - How to Design and Implement a Plugin architecture in Python](https://mathieularose.com/plugin-architecture-in-python)

Great terminology, right off the bat:

* Plugin 'discovery'

Yes! Stolen!

A glance at [the source code for his utt app](https://github.com/larose/utt/tree/master/utt) 
tells me `quickhost` is after the same feel - but I'm not coming close to his
level of knowledge! Great name, btw.


### [Charles White - Plugin Architecture in Python](https://dev.to/charlesw001/plugin-architecture-in-python-jla)

## Plugins questions I have

* Should plugins be able to use modules from the main `quickhost` package?

I've done enough Python3 scripting to know where I have some blind-spots.
I can easily say that knowing beforehand what methods a class is expected to
have has helped me reach this point in developing the `main-args` branch so
quickly.

However, extending a set of base classes is something I honestly can't say I've
ever needed to do, up until this point. Now that I'm pausing to reflect, I am
wishing I had known to do this sooner 

* is using `importlib` the only way?

What if plugins were a package with a `__main__.py` that `quickhost` would
invoke?

* What's the level of difficutly like for implementing a feature for the cli to
  automatically fetch plugins at runtime?

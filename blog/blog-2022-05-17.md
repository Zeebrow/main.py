I lied, I'm going to write tests.  I also didn't sleep well.

I had to fix a couple things about ssh keys. `main.py` works about as well as I
remember the shell scripts. But I also realized how much is acking - no
`destroy()`, having to manually check that hosts are running, `--dry-run`
generally sucking ass, and other ... bugs. It's grade-A yikes.

It's very inconvenient to have to learn all of this through starting actual
hosts, not to mention expensive. So I'm thinking:

* collect samples of response data as I use the app (see `store_test_data`, `mock-data/`)
* use mock-data and `pytest-mock` to spoof a `boto3.client('ec2')` 
* `pytest` basically runs variations of `main.py`

le's go!

## Do one thing and do it well

I was writing the `check_running_as_user()` function, which returns a pair of
strings (a 'good' and 'bad' IAM username). Then I realized I didn't need to
return anything more than 'True' or 'False'.

I mean *sure* it's nice to know more, but I bet that a few weeks time would be
enough for me to comletely forget where those usernames were being set.

I am grasshopper.

## code completion

I *detest* looking through boto3 docs, just to confirm whether or not something
exists.

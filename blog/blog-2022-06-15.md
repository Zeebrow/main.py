You don't *plan* on hitting roadblocks.  When I do, I take a break. 

If someone were here to help or push me in a direction, it wouldn't have taken so long. Friends (or a boss) can really snap you out of an ego trip.

Since I don't have the luxury for this project ... yeah it's going to have to be a config file.

I already have the ini but it's such overkill. Getting config from it is central to the ecosystem going here. Ideally:

```
# quickhost.conf
app1=aws
app2=azure
app3=vultr
...
```

If I widdle it down, I can make `quickhost.conf` look like

```
# quickhost.conf
[app1:aws]
[app2:azure]
[app3:vultr]
...
```

Which looks absolutely 1337 lmao. 

I've thought about what to do about this state-like config file. I don't see a way around it - but if you do, let me know!

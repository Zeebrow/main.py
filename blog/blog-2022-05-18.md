Learning `pytest`. Isn't go well.

Long one because I have no idea what I'm doing.

I need to learn `botocore.Stub` to figure out how to patch any `boto3.client()`
api calls - but I can't figure out from the boto3 docs if this is something
that's even supported. There's a few blogs out there that suggest patching an
underscore 'private' method nested in `boto3.client`. I haven't found any other
options yet, although there is a boto3-mock package out there on pip. I'd
rather stick to what's being maintained by known names, or make the thing
myself... 

On a more hopeful note. Once I get a unittests made for `describe` actions ---
I can look back on them as a template for `create`, `update`, and `destroy`.
Azure, Vultr, those cloud provdeded servers better have similar hooks into
patching their api calls, lol.

Looks like if I take the `boto3.client` out of `AWSApp`, I can more easily use
the above stubber to mock calls.

But can I substitute each use with 

```python
# https://botocore.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/tutorial/index.html
import botocore.session
session = botocore.session.get_session()
client = session.create_client('ec2', region_name='us-west-2')
```

or whatever? It really is whatever, I have no idea how mixing will work.

* mock just one (1) call
  * make burner acct for help, rying out new (do it for specific resources)
* Investigate 
```python
client = boto3.client('ec2')
client.describe_security_groups(**params) 
# vs
resource = boto3.resource('ec2')
# https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/clients.html
```
The app here uses a single `boto3.client('ec2')` object and shares it with
`AWSHost`, `SG`, `KP` through `AWSApp`.

1. Arrange - prepare to act
2. Act - "state changer"
3. Assert - measure
4. Cleanup - make sure other tests aren't influenced by past `act`s

* The program's behavior exists between `act` and `assert`
